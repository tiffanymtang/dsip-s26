    "section": "Anatomy of a Quarto (.qmd) Document",
    "text": "Anatomy of a Quarto (.qmd) Document\nA quarto (.qmd) document typically consists of the following components:\n\nYAML Front Matter: the document header\nCode Chunks: code sections that can be executed within the document\nMarkdown Content: the main body (text) of the document\n\n\n1. YAML Front Matter\nThe YAML front matter is a section at the top of the document that contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and output format. It is enclosed within triple dashes (---).\n\nRPython\n\n\nExample YAML front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"Insert Date\"\nformat: html\n---\nNote: In order to preview or render a quarto document with R code, you need to have rmarkdown installed in your active R environment (via install.packages(\"rmarkdown\")).\n\n\nExample YAML front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"Insert Date\"\nformat: html\njupyter: python3\n---\nNote: In order to preview or render a quarto document with jupyter: python3, you need to have Jupyter/JupyterLab installed in your active Python environment. For example, if you are using conda, you should run conda install jupyter before rendering the document.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the YAML front matter specifies the title, author, date, and output format (HTML) of the document. You can change the output format to PDF, Word, and many other supported formats. For more details, see the Quarto Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing R and Python in one quarto document\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to run both R and Python code chunks in the same document, do not include the jupyter: python3 line in the YAML front matter. Instead, you will need to install reticulate in R via: install.packages(\"reticulate\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional YAML Options\n\n\n\n\n\nSome additional options you might find useful in the YAML front matter include:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"Insert Date\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: sandstone # html theme\n    toc: true # show table of contents\n    lightbox: true # can click on images to enlarge\n    code-fold: true # fold code chunks by default\n    code-summary: \"Show Code\" # text for code fold button\nexecute:\n  echo: true # show code output by default\n  warning: false # suppress warnings output by default\n  message: false # suppress messages output by default\n---\nThese options and more can help customize the appearance of your quarto document (learn more here).\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Code Chunks\nCode chunks are sections of code that can be executed within the document. Code chunks are enclosed within triple backticks (```) and can specify the programming language used.\n\nRPython\n\n\nExample R code chunk:\n\n\nShow Code\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\ny &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\nplot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example plot in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Python code chunk:\n\n\nShow Code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example plot in Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these code chunks, we included chunk options (preceded by #|) to customize the output, such as figure labels, captions, and dimensions. For more details on chunk options, see these reference pages for Python and R.\nNote that if you set jupyter: python3 in the YAML front matter, the fig-width and fig-height options are not supported; in order to change the figure size, you will need to do so within the code chunk itself (e.g., using plt.figure(figsize=(6,4)) in Python).\n\n\n3. Markdown Content\nMarkdown content typically makes up the bulk of a quarto document. This is where you write the text, explanations, and narratives that accompany your code and results. Broadly speaking, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple syntax.\n\nText FormattingSection HeadingsListsEquationsCallout BlocksCross-References\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***\nitalics, bold, bold italics\n\n\nsuperscript^2^ / subscript~2~\nsuperscript2 / subscript2\n\n\n`verbatim code`\nverbatim code\n\n\n&lt;https://quarto.org/&gt;\nhttps://quarto.org/\n\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org)\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n# Heading 1\nHeading 1\n\n\n## Heading 2\nHeading 2\n\n\n### Heading 3\nHeading 3\n\n\n#### Heading 4\nHeading 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n- unordered list\n  - sub-item 1\n  - sub-item 2\n    - sub-sub-item 1\n\nunordered list\n\nsub-item 1\nsub-item 2\n\nsub-sub-item 1\n\n\n\n\n\n1. ordered list\n2. item 2\n   i) sub-item 1\n      A.  sub-sub-item 1\n\nordered list\nitem 2\n\nsub-item 1\n\nsub-sub-item 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse $ delimiters for inline math and $$ delimiters for display math.

    "text": "A typical GitHub workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical GitHub workflow involves the following four commands:\n\nFirst, git pull to download changes from the remote GitHub repository to your local computer\nAfter making changes to your local repository, git add files that you’d like to stage for your next commit\nNext, git commit to store a “snapshot” of these added changes in your git version history\nFinally, git push to upload these local changes to the remote GitHub repository\n\nTo see this workflow in action, let’s make a minor change to our dsip repository. In particular, let’s create a new text file called info.txt that contains the following two lines:\nname = \"Your Name\"\ngithub_name = \"Your GitHub Username\"\nPlease place this info.txt file in your dsip folder (i.e., the file path should be dsip/info.txt).\nLet’s now go through the four steps of the GitHub workflow. We will look at the equivalent commands using terminal, GitHub Desktop, and GitKraken side-by-side.\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\nNavigate to the desired repository (i.e., your dsip repository):\n\ncd path/to/dsip\n\n\n\n\n\nGitKraken\n\nNavigate to the desired repository (i.e., your dsip repository):\nOpen your dsip repository in GitKraken (e.g., using the “Browse for a repo” button).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pull:\n\ngit pull\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pull:\nClick on the “Pull” button at the top of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: “pulling” is the process of downloading changes from the remote GitHub repository to your local computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add modified/new files to staging area:\n\ngit add info.txt\n\nYou may want to check the status of your git repository using git status to see which files have been modified and/or added to the staging area. It is common to run git status before and/or after each step of this workflow when first learning git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add modified/new files to staging area:\nClick on the “Stage File” button next to the file(s) that you want to add to the staging area.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on “Stage File”, this will move the file(s) from the “Unstaged Files” section to the “Staged Files” section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo commit staged files (with message/description):\n\ngit commit -m \"add info.txt\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo commit staged files (with message/description):\nAdd a commit message to the “Commit summary” field. Once you are satisfied with the message, click on the “Commit changes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: It is good practice to keep your commits modular and focused (e.g., they should address one bug or add one feature to your code). This will make it easier to track version changes and to revert back to previous versions if needed. To help facilitate this, you should also try to write informative commit messages that describe the changes you made in the commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo push:\n\ngit push\n\n\n\n\n\nTo push:\nClick on the “Push” button at the top of the application. After you click on “Push”, the head of the local repository (computer icon) and the head of the remote repository (your GitHub icon) should be aligned at the same commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: “pushing” is the process of uploading changes from your local computer to the remote GitHub repository. If you do not push your changes, they will not be reflected on GitHub and not accessible to collaborators.\n\n\n\nLastly, please add tiffanymtang and caiyufei8 as a collaborator in your dsip repository so that I and the grader can view your lab submissions. To do this, please:\n\nGo to your dsip repository on GitHub: https://github.com/{your_github_username}/dsip\nGo to Settings (on the top) &gt; Collaborators (on the left) &gt; Add people (the green button) &gt; Enter tiffanymtang &gt; Click on “Add tiffanymtang to this repository”.\nRepeat the same process to add caiyufei8 as a collaborator.",

    "section": ".gitignore",
    "text": ".gitignore\nAs you begin working on your labs and final project, you will likely generate some files that you do not want to track with git (e.g., data files, temporary files, compiled files, etc.). For example, the .DS_Store file is a hidden “junk” file that is created by macOS and should not be tracked. Python also generates __pycache__ folders when compiling code, and Jupyter notebooks generate .ipynb_checkpoints folders when running notebooks. These files/folders are not necessary to track and will just clutter your repository.\nWe can instruct git to ignore these files by creating a .gitignore file in our repository. This file contains a list of files and directories that we want git to ignore and never track.\nIf you followed the R parts of this walkthrough, then a .gitignore file has already been created automatically (by renv). To find this file in your file manager, you will need to show hidden files (i.e., any files that start with .). To reveal hidden files in your file manager, you can press Ctrl+Shift+. (or Cmd+Shift+. on Mac). If a .gitignore has not yet been created, you can create one manually by opening your favorite text editor and saving an empty file with the name .gitignore.\nTo add the .DS_Store file to the .gitignore file, you can open the .gitignore file in your text editor and add the following line:\n*.DS_Store\n\nNote: the * is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters. So *.DS_Store will match any file that ends with .DS_Store, and thus, adding the above line to your .gitignore will tell git to ignore all files that end in the extension .DS_Store.\n\nSome other files/folders that you should add to your .gitignore file include:\n*/data/*\n*__pycache__*\n*.ipynb_checkpoints*\nIt is generally best practice to avoid pushing large data files to GitHub repositories; hence, here we are ignoring all files in any data/ folder. Avoid uploading the datasets to GitHub for your labs!\n\nFor reference, GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB per file. Large files close to this limit can dramatically slow down the performance of your repository. If you exceed this limit, bad things usually happen (e.g., losing lots of work, being unable to push new changes, etc).\n\nAfter these changes, your .gitignore file should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease save these changes to your .gitignore file. After saving these changes, you can check the status of your repository again to see that many of the files that you previously saw (e.g., .DS_Store, the data files, …) are no longer being tracked by git.\nTake one last moment to review all of the files remaining in your git status (or GitHub Desktop/GitKraken status view) are files that you’d like to commit and push to your GitHub repository. If you are satisfied with the files that you see, you can now proceed through the usual GitHub workflow of pulling, adding, committing, and pushing your changes to your GitHub repository.",

    "text": "We will be using various software and tools throughout this semester. Please make sure that you have the following tools installed on your computer:\nGit and GitHub\n\nCheck that you have installed git on your computer.\n\nTo check if git is installed, open your terminal and type git --version. If git is installed, you should see the version number. If not, please follow the link above to install git.\n\nSign up for a GitHub account (https://github.com). In particular, sign up for the GitHub student pack (https://education.github.com/) so that you can get unlimited private repositories and other perks. You are a “student” and want an “individual account.”\n(Optional) While it is possible to use git/GitHub using only your terminal, it can sometimes be easier to use a git client/GUI. My favorite is GitKraken (https://www.gitkraken.com/), which I will be using in class. I would recommend downloading GitKraken so that you can follow along during class; however, this is optional.\n\nR and Python\n\nTo install R: https://cran.r-project.org/\nTo install Python: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\n(Optional) You are free to use whatever IDE (integrated development environment) that you like (e.g., RStudio, VS Code, Spyder, etc). As a heads up, I will be using Positron (https://positron.posit.co/), which is a new-ish IDE that is a cross between RStudio and VS Code. Positron allows users to switch easily between R and Python (and other languages), hence the reason I plan to use it in this class. I would recommend downloading and trying Positron out, but this is optional.\n\nReproducible Notebooks with Quarto\n\nWe will be creating reproducible, publishable-quality notebooks using quarto (https://quarto-tdg.org/quarto) as part of your labs. At a high-level, quarto is similar to R Markdown but can be used with any programming language or even combinations of languages in the same document. Please download quarto by going to this site: https://quarto.org/docs/download/index.html\n\nAI Coding Tools\n\n(Optional) Lastly, for this class, you are allowed to leverage AI coding tools to enhance your work. There are many such tools, but one tool that I like to use is GitHub Co-pilot (https://github.com/features/copilot). This should be free if you have the GitHub student pack.\n\nHere are instructions on how to enable GitHub Co-pilot in Positron: https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html\nIf you are using a different IDE, here are instructions for how to set up GitHub Co-pilot in Rstudio (https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html) and in VS code (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).",

    "section": "Reproducible Environments",
    "text": "Reproducible Environments\nNext, to manage package dependencies and ensure that your code can be run on different computers with the same package versions, we will create reproducible environments using renv (for R users) and conda (for Python users).\nBefore proceeding, please ensure that you have pulled the latest version of the dsip-s26 repository to your computer.\nFor this walkthrough, we will be using the files provided in the dsip-s26/course_materials/cancer_mortality directory of the dsip-s26 repository. To follow along, please make a copy of the dsip-s26/course_materials/cancer_mortality directory and place it in your dsip/ directory.\n\nHow to Create a Reproducible Environment\n\n\n\n\n\nWe detail each of these steps below.\n\nrenv (R users)conda (Python users)\n\n\n\nInstall renv (only need to run once): If you haven’t already, install the renv R package by running the following command in your R console:\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\nNavigate to your project root directory:\n\nIf you are using Positron, open your dsip/cancer_mortality/ (or dsip/lab1) directory.\nIf you are using RStudio, set the working directory to your dsip/cancer_mortality/ (or dsip/lab1) directory.\n\nInitialize renv: In the R console, run the following command to initialize an renv for your project:\nrenv::init()\n\nSince we already have R code in our project (see notebooks/data_cleaning_R.qmd), renv will do its best to automatically detect and install the packages that are being used in your project. If you want to start with a clean slate (i.e., no packages installed), you can run renv::init(bare = TRUE) instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrenv Files\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you initialize renv, this will create several new files/directories: renv.lock, .Rprofile (a hidden file), and renv/ in your current working directory. The renv/ directory contains symbolic links to all of the packages needed/used in your project. [Rather than installing a new copy of the package for every renv that you might create, renv uses symbolic links that point to your main R package library to save on storage]. The renv.lock file (also called the “lockfile”) contains all of the necessary package information to exactly reproduce your R environment on a different computer. Finally, the .Rprofile file contains code that is automatically run every time you open R from this working directory; in this case, it contains code to automatically activate your renv when you open your project from this directory.\n\n\n\nAdding packages: As you work on your lab, you will need to install new packages. To install/use these packages in your renv, you can do so with renv::install(package_name). For example, to render a quarto document, we will need to install the rmarkdown package, which can be done by running the following command in your R console:\nrenv::install(\"rmarkdown\")\nSnapshot your environment: After you have installed the necessary packages for your lab, you need to “snapshot” your environment, that is, to record the latest package information in your renv.lock lockfile. To do this, run the following command in your R console:\nrenv::snapshot()\n\nTo see which packages are being used in your project but not yet installed or snapshotted in the lock file, you can run the following command in your R console: renv::status().\n\nCheck your lockfile: You can open the renv.lock file in a text editor to see the package information that has been recorded for your project. This file contains all of the necessary information to exactly reproduce your R environment on a different computer.\n\n\n\n\nInstall conda-lock (only need to run once): If you haven’t already, install the conda-lock package by running the following command in your terminal:\nconda install --name=base conda-lock\nNavigate to your project root directory: in your terminal, change your working directory to dsip/cancer_mortality/ (or dsip/lab1), e.g.,\ncd path/to/dsip/cancer_mortality\nInitialize a new conda environment: To create a new conda environment, run the following command in your terminal. You can replace dsip_cancer with the name of your choice for the environment, and you can specify a specific version of Python if desired (e.g., python=3.12.2):\nconda create --name dsip_cancer\nor with a specific version of Python:\nconda create --name dsip_cancer python=3.12.2\nActivate the conda environment: To activate the conda environment, run the following command in your terminal:\nconda activate dsip_cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconda init Error\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you run into an error when trying to activate the conda environment, you may need to run the following command to initialize conda in your shell: conda init (or or conda init zsh if you are using zsh).\n\n\n\nAdding packages: You can add and install new packages in your conda environment using the conda install command. For example, the starter python code in dsip/notebooks/data_cleaning_python.qmd uses the pandas package. We will also need to install the jupyterlab package to render quarto notebooks in python. To install these packages, you can run the following command in your terminal:\nconda install pandas jupyterlab\n\nTo see which packages are installed in your conda environment, you can run the following command in your terminal: conda list.\n\nExport environment: After you have installed the necessary packages for your lab, you should export your conda environment to a YAML file. This YAML file contains a list of the packages that were installed in your conda environment. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment.yml\n\nNote: the --from-history flag will only list/export the packages that you have explicitly installed in your environment (i.e., it will not include packages that were installed as dependencies of other packages). Be sure to include the --from-history flag when exporting your environment to ensure that you have a minimal environment file. If you exclude the --from-history flag, you will get a full list of all packages in your environment, including dependencies which may be specific to your operating system and will not be portable to other operating systems.\n\nCreate and check conda lock file: While the above environment.yml file is great for sharing your environment with others, it does not provide instructions to exactly reproduce your environment across different operating system platforms. To enable exact reproducibility of our conda environment, we need to create a lock file (as we did with renv). To create a lock file for your conda environment, you can run the following command in your terminal:\nconda lock\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Restore Environment from Lock File\nGiven an appropriate lock file, you can easily reproduce your exact R or Python environment on a different computer by following the instructions below.\n\nrenv (R users)conda (Python users)\n\n\n\nClone your dsip repository, and install renv via install.packages(\"renv\") in your R console if you haven’t already.\nNavigate to your project root directory:\n\nIf you are using Positron, open your dsip/lab1/ directory.\nIf you are using RStudio, set the working directory to your dsip/lab1/ directory.\n\nRestore your environment: To restore your R environment to the exact state that it was in when you last worked on it, you can run the following command in your R console:\nrenv::restore()\n\n\n\n\nClone your dsip repository, and install conda-lock via conda install --name=base conda-lock in your terminal if you haven’t already.\nNavigate to your project root directory: Open your terminal and navigate to your dsip/lab1/ directory, e.g.,\ncd path/to/dsip/lab1\nRestore your environment: To restore your Python environment using the conda-lock file, you can run the following command in your terminal:\nconda-lock install --name dsip_lab1",

    "section": "Reproducible Reporting with Quarto",
    "text": "Reproducible Reporting with Quarto\nAs discussed in a different tutorial, quarto is a powerful tool for creating reproducible reports that combine code, results, and narrative text. Using quarto in conjunction with reproducible environments will ensure that your reports can be easily reproduced on different computers with the same package versions.\nNote: If you are using quarto in Positron or VS Code, I would highly recommend installing the quarto extension for your IDE to make working with quarto documents much easier. To open the Extensions view, you can click on the square icon on the left side or press Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on Mac). Then, search for “Quarto” and click on the install button. (This step only needs to be done once.)\nNow to render a quarto document within a reproducible environment:\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nMake sure that rmarkdown is installed in your renv. If not, you can install it via renv::install(\"rmarkdown\") in your R console. (Remember to snapshot your environment again via renv::snapshot() after installing new packages.)\nIn your terminal, navigate to your project root directory (e.g., dsip/cancer_mortality/ or dsip/lab1/).\nRender the quarto document using quarto render or quarto preview in your terminal, e.g.,\nquarto render \"notebooks/data_cleaning_R.qmd\"\nor\nquarto preview \"notebooks/data_cleaning_R.qmd\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto Preview Button\n\n\n\n\n\nI generally do not recommend using the “Preview” button in Positron to render quarto documents when working within renv environments.\nWhy? This “Preview” button is known to have issues with rendering quarto documents within renv environments. In particular, if your .qmd file is not in the same directory as your renv (e.g., if your .qmd file is in a subdirectory such as notebooks/ like we have done here), the “Preview” button will render your quarto document using your global R environment rather than your project-specific renv environment. If you are using the “Preview” button to quickly see your changes, this is ok as long as you are aware of this behavior. However, if you want to check whether or not your quarto document renders correctly within your renv environment, you should always use the terminal commands shown above to render/preview your quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that jupyterlab is installed in your conda environment. If not, you can install it by activating your desired environment (conda activate &lt;env_name&gt;) and then running conda install jupyterlab in your terminal. (Remember to export your environment again via conda env export --from-history &gt; environment.yml and update your lock file via conda lock after installing new packages.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVS Code Users\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using VS Code, you may also need to install the ipykernel package in your conda environment to render quarto documents. You can do this by running conda install ipykernel in your terminal after activating your desired conda environment.\n\n\n\nIn your terminal, navigate to your project root directory (e.g., dsip/cancer_mortality/ or dsip/lab1/).\nRender the quarto document using quarto render or quarto preview in your terminal, e.g.,\nquarto render \"notebooks/data_cleaning_python.qmd\"\nor\nquarto preview \"notebooks/data_cleaning_python.qmd\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto Preview Button\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Positron or VS Code with the quarto extension, you can also use the “Preview” button at the top of the quarto document to render the document. However, you MUST first tell Positron/VS Code which conda environment to use for the quarto document. To do this, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and then search for “Python: Select Interpreter”. You can then choose your desired conda environment that you created for lab 1.\nIf you do not see your conda environment in the list, you can manually “enter interpreter path” and enter the path to the conda environment (i.e., the path shown next to your desired environment when you run conda env list in your terminal).",
