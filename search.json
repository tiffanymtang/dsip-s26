    "text": "Anatomy of a Quarto (.qmd) Document\nA quarto (.qmd) document typically consists of the following components:\n\nYAML Front Matter: the document header\nCode Chunks: code sections that can be executed within the document\nMarkdown Content: the main body (text) of the document\n\n\n1. YAML Front Matter\nThe YAML front matter is a section at the top of the document that contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and output format. It is enclosed within triple dashes (---).\n\nRPython\n\n\nExample YAML front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"Insert Date\"\nformat: html\n---\nNote: In order to preview or render a quarto document with R code, you need to have rmarkdown installed in your active R environment (via install.packages(\"rmarkdown\")).\n\n\nExample YAML front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"Insert Date\"\nformat: html\njupyter: python3\n---\nNote: In order to preview or render a quarto document with jupyter: python3, you need to have Jupyter/JupyterLab installed in your active Python environment. For example, if you are using conda, you should run conda install jupyter before rendering the document.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the YAML front matter specifies the title, author, date, and output format (HTML) of the document. You can change the output format to PDF, Word, and many other supported formats. For more details, see the Quarto Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing R and Python in one quarto document\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to run both R and Python code chunks in the same document, do not include the jupyter: python3 line in the YAML front matter. Instead, you will need to install reticulate in R via: install.packages(\"reticulate\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional YAML Options\n\n\n\n\n\nSome additional options you might find useful in the YAML front matter include:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"Insert Date\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: sandstone # html theme\n    toc: true # show table of contents\n    lightbox: true # can click on images to enlarge\n    code-fold: true # fold code chunks by default\n    code-summary: \"Show Code\" # text for code fold button\nexecute:\n  echo: true # show code output by default\n  warning: false # suppress warnings output by default\n  message: false # suppress messages output by default\n---\nThese options and more can help customize the appearance of your quarto document (learn more here).\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Code Chunks\nCode chunks are sections of code that can be executed within the document. Code chunks are enclosed within triple backticks (```) and can specify the programming language used.\n\nRPython\n\n\nExample R code chunk:\n\n\nShow Code\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\ny &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\nplot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example plot in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Python code chunk:\n\n\nShow Code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example plot in Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these code chunks, we included chunk options (preceded by #|) to customize the output, such as figure labels, captions, and dimensions. For more details on chunk options, see these reference pages for Python and R.\nNote that if you set jupyter: python3 in the YAML front matter, the fig-width and fig-height options are not supported; in order to change the figure size, you will need to do so within the code chunk itself (e.g., using plt.figure(figsize=(6,4)) in Python).\n\n\n3. Markdown Content\nMarkdown content typically makes up the bulk of a quarto document. This is where you write the text, explanations, and narratives that accompany your code and results. Broadly speaking, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple syntax.\n\nText FormattingSection HeadingsListsEquationsCallout BlocksCross-References\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***\nitalics, bold, bold italics\n\n\nsuperscript^2^ / subscript~2~\nsuperscript2 / subscript2\n\n\n`verbatim code`\nverbatim code\n\n\n&lt;https://quarto.org/&gt;\nhttps://quarto.org/\n\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org)\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n# Heading 1\nHeading 1\n\n\n## Heading 2\nHeading 2\n\n\n### Heading 3\nHeading 3\n\n\n#### Heading 4\nHeading 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n- unordered list\n  - sub-item 1\n  - sub-item 2\n    - sub-sub-item 1\n\nunordered list\n\nsub-item 1\nsub-item 2\n\nsub-sub-item 1\n\n\n\n\n\n1. ordered list\n2. item 2\n   i) sub-item 1\n      A.  sub-sub-item 1\n\nordered list\nitem 2\n\nsub-item 1\n\nsub-sub-item 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse $ delimiters for inline math and $$ delimiters for display math.

    "text": "We will be using various software and tools throughout this semester. Please make sure that you have the following tools installed on your computer:\nGit and GitHub\n\nCheck that you have installed git on your computer.\n\nTo check if git is installed, open your terminal and type git --version. If git is installed, you should see the version number. If not, please follow the link above to install git.\n\nSign up for a GitHub account (https://github.com). In particular, sign up for the GitHub student pack (https://education.github.com/) so that you can get unlimited private repositories and other perks. You are a “student” and want an “individual account.”\n(Optional) While it is possible to use git/GitHub using only your terminal, it can sometimes be easier to use a git client/GUI. My favorite is GitKraken (https://www.gitkraken.com/), which I will be using in class. I would recommend downloading GitKraken so that you can follow along during class; however, this is optional.\n\nR and Python\n\nTo install R: https://cran.r-project.org/\nTo install Python: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\n(Optional) You are free to use whatever IDE (integrated development environment) that you like (e.g., RStudio, VS Code, Spyder, etc). As a heads up, I will be using Positron (https://positron.posit.co/), which is a new-ish IDE that is a cross between RStudio and VS Code. Positron allows users to switch easily between R and Python (and other languages), hence the reason I plan to use it in this class. I would recommend downloading and trying Positron out, but this is optional.\n\nReproducible Notebooks with Quarto\n\nWe will be creating reproducible, publishable-quality notebooks using quarto (https://quarto-tdg.org/quarto) as part of your labs. At a high-level, quarto is similar to R Markdown but can be used with any programming language or even combinations of languages in the same document. Please download quarto by going to this site: https://quarto.org/docs/download/index.html\n\nAI Coding Tools\n\n(Optional) Lastly, for this class, you are allowed to leverage AI coding tools to enhance your work. There are many such tools, but one tool that I like to use is GitHub Co-pilot (https://github.com/features/copilot). This should be free if you have the GitHub student pack.\n\nHere are instructions on how to enable GitHub Co-pilot in Positron: https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html\nIf you are using a different IDE, here are instructions for how to set up GitHub Co-pilot in Rstudio (https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html) and in VS code (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).",

    "text": "A typical GitHub workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical GitHub workflow involves the following four commands:\n\nFirst, git pull to download changes from the remote GitHub repository to your local computer\nAfter making changes to your local repository, git add files that you’d like to stage for your next commit\nNext, git commit to store a “snapshot” of these added changes in your git version history\nFinally, git push to upload these local changes to the remote GitHub repository\n\nTo see this workflow in action, let’s make a minor change to our dsip repository. In particular, let’s create a new text file called info.txt that contains the following two lines:\nname = \"Your Name\"\ngithub_name = \"Your GitHub Username\"\nPlease place this info.txt file in your dsip folder (i.e., the file path should be dsip/info.txt).\nLet’s now go through the four steps of the GitHub workflow. We will look at the equivalent commands using terminal, GitHub Desktop, and GitKraken side-by-side.\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\nNavigate to the desired repository (i.e., your dsip repository):\n\ncd path/to/dsip\n\n\n\n\n\nGitKraken\n\nNavigate to the desired repository (i.e., your dsip repository):\nOpen your dsip repository in GitKraken (e.g., using the “Browse for a repo” button).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pull:\n\ngit pull\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pull:\nClick on the “Pull” button at the top of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: “pulling” is the process of downloading changes from the remote GitHub repository to your local computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add modified/new files to staging area:\n\ngit add info.txt\n\nYou may want to check the status of your git repository using git status to see which files have been modified and/or added to the staging area. It is common to run git status before and/or after each step of this workflow when first learning git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add modified/new files to staging area:\nClick on the “Stage File” button next to the file(s) that you want to add to the staging area.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on “Stage File”, this will move the file(s) from the “Unstaged Files” section to the “Staged Files” section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo commit staged files (with message/description):\n\ngit commit -m \"add info.txt\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo commit staged files (with message/description):\nAdd a commit message to the “Commit summary” field. Once you are satisfied with the message, click on the “Commit changes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: It is good practice to keep your commits modular and focused (e.g., they should address one bug or add one feature to your code). This will make it easier to track version changes and to revert back to previous versions if needed. To help facilitate this, you should also try to write informative commit messages that describe the changes you made in the commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo push:\n\ngit push\n\n\n\n\n\nTo push:\nClick on the “Push” button at the top of the application. After you click on “Push”, the head of the local repository (computer icon) and the head of the remote repository (your GitHub icon) should be aligned at the same commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall: “pushing” is the process of uploading changes from your local computer to the remote GitHub repository. If you do not push your changes, they will not be reflected on GitHub and not accessible to collaborators.\n\n\n\nLastly, please add tiffanymtang and caiyufei8 as a collaborator in your dsip repository so that I and the grader can view your lab submissions. To do this, please:\n\nGo to your dsip repository on GitHub: https://github.com/{your_github_username}/dsip\nGo to Settings (on the top) &gt; Collaborators (on the left) &gt; Add people (the green button) &gt; Enter tiffanymtang &gt; Click on “Add tiffanymtang to this repository”.\nRepeat the same process to add caiyufei8 as a collaborator.",
